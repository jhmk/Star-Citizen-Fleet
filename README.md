1. Import the "star-citizen-fleet.sql" from "import" to your database
2. Open "index.php" from "upload" and edit line 15 to connect to your database
3. Optional: If you changed the table name, search and replace `star-citizen-fleet`
4. Upload all files from "upload" to your webspace - maybe "fleet" or else
5. You're done and the script should show you this: http://misc.bofb.org/fleet/

If you want to edit the ship count:
Connect to the database with your prefered MySQL tool like phpMyAdmin or else.
